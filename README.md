# twitter-sentiment-analysis-global-warming

Sentiment analysis gives us insight into the things that automate mining of attitudes, opinions, views and emotions from text, speech, tweets and database sources. However, to fully explore the possibilities of this text analysis technique, we need data visualization tools to help organize the results. Visually representing the content of a text document is one of the most important tasks in the field of text mining.

However, there are some gaps between visualizing unstructured (text) data and structured data. Many text visualizations do not represent the text directly, they represent an output of a language model. In this post, we will use tweets extracted using Twitter API, store tweets as text data, classify opinions in text into categories like positive, or negative or neutral, create a function to calculate the score of each type of opinion in the text and try to explore and visualize as much as we can, using Python libraries.

Tweets can be imported into Python using Twitter API, then the text data has to be cleaned before analysis, for example removing emoticons, removing URLs, etc.
